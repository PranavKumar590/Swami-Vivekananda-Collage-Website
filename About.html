<!--About us content-->
<secttion class="about">
<p>Swami Vivekananda College formally known as Shri Vivekananda High School was the
    brainchild of Swami Rudrananda, Late Mr. A. D Patel and Sadhu Kuppuswami and
    Sangam stalwarts. In 1939 Swami Rudrananda ji was sent to Fiji by the Ramakrishna
    Mission, a religious humanitarian organization formed by the school's patron saint
    Swami Vivekananda.
    Shri Vivekananda High School humbly opened its doors to 19 students in 1 classroom
    on the 9th of March 1949, the date which coincides with the birthday of Shri
    Ramakrishna, towards the end of the year the roll increased to 32 students and 2
    teachers. The school was first situated at the Nadi Sangam Primary School premises.
    The Jack and Jill kindergarten stands at this location today. During the 1950's as the roll
    increased the school was moved to the banks of Nadi River.
    Shri Vivekananda High School was a boarding institution catering for children of the
    sugarcane farmers who came from as far as Labasa, Tavua and Rakiraki. The Malolo
    wing was opened on the 4th of February in 1959. A lot of hard work and effort was put in
    by so many people over the past 62 years to get this prestigious institution to the stage
    where it is today. These includes the past and present Swamiji's, Principals, staff,
    students, their parents and various donors' and well-wishers of this institution. Without
    the contributions of these people, the College would not be where it is and what it is
    today.</p>
